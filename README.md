This code creates a GUI using the tkinter library that allows the user to train and visualize a decision tree classifier. The user can open a CSV file, train the classifier on the data, visualize the decision tree, save the rules to an XML file, make predictions using the trained classifier, and save and load the trained classifier using the joblib library. The GUI includes buttons for each of these actions and displays the decision tree as an image.
